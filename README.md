A Brawl Stars trophy counter!
Sooooo uhh what does it do exactly?
lets say you have a goal of reaching 500+ trophies on every single one of your brawlers.. 
And lets say you have 17 brawlers that did NOT reach 500+ trophies yet.
So you type in that you have 17 characters, and that your goal is 500 trophies, then you type in the individual numbers of trophies..
And then it will give you a total number of trophies gained, if you complete the push, and if you enter the total amount of your trophies, then it will show you the amount of trophies youre going to have once you complete it.

Good Luck!
